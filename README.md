# DolphinosWatch
Named for our favorite League of Legends player, Dolphinos Watch is a Discord Bot that automatically posts whenever he starts the game, enters the lobby, or joins a game.

Bonus: It automatically sends daily/weekly reports of time played, games played, win/loss ratio (to gauge how salty he is)
